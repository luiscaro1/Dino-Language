Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 2 3 4

term                 : 3 4 5 6 7

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . factor
    (1) factor -> . DIGIT
    (2) factor -> . expression
    (3) expression -> . expression PLUS term
    (4) expression -> . expression MINUS term
    (7) expression -> . term
    (5) term -> . term TIMES factor
    (6) term -> . term DIVIDED factor
    (8) term -> . factor

    DIGIT           shift and go to state 2

    factor                         shift and go to state 1
    expression                     shift and go to state 3
    term                           shift and go to state 4

state 1

    (0) S' -> factor .
    (8) term -> factor .
