### Dino Programming Language

Dino is a simple and light-weight programming language focused on the English syntax. It uses real-life sentences to perform basic arithmetic and assignment operations. With all the upcoming technologies, we believe the industry has shied away from simplicity. We want to engage all audiences especially children and people with mental disabilities. Programming can be hard to grasp at first but it doesn’t have to be. Dino can be learned in an hour, we believe this empowers young developers and inspires them to tackle larger languages in the future. Dino doesn’t bring anything new to the industry, it makes the common case fast and allows younger generations to acquire exposure. Invest in the youth of today and they’ll be the pioneers of tomorrow.
