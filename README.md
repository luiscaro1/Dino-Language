# **Dino Programming Language**

Dino is a simple and light-weight programming language focused on the English syntax. It uses real-life sentences to perform basic arithmetic and assignment operations. With all the upcoming technologies, we believe the industry has shied away from simplicity. We want to engage all audiences especially children and people with mental disabilities. Programming can be hard to grasp at first but it doesn’t have to be. Dino can be learned in an hour, we believe this empowers young developers and inspires them to tackle larger languages in the future. Dino doesn’t bring anything new to the industry, it makes the common case fast and allows younger generations to acquire exposure. Invest in the youth of today and they’ll be the pioneers of tomorrow.

## **Get Started**

Dino, in its simplicity, is based on English sentences. Based on the type of sentences, the program collects the data from the paragraph and stores it in an internal object-oriented data structure. There are four different types of sentences: expressions, definitions, questions and modifications.

### **Sentence**
  * **Expressions**
    Expressions represent mathematical values by adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.
        I.e. 2 times 3. or  2 plus 4.
  * **Definitions**
    Definitions have the ability to create objects that can store any type of information from values to list of values.
        I.e. Luis is a person.  or   Animals are pigs, cats, dogs.
  * **Questions**
  Questions are used to access any object’s information.
        I.e. What is the height of Luis? What are Animals? or  What is the length of Animals?
  * **Modifications**
  Modifications are sentences that can modify or even create an attribute for an object.
        I.e. The height of Luis is 176.  or  The model of Car is Fiesta.

### **Objects**
Objects in Dino can be thought of as a dictionary with its default parameter defining its' type. These objects store attributes with their respected values and can be accessed anytime using questions or modifications.

**Object visualization:**
	Some Object => [ ‘type’:Name , ‘attr1’:value1 , ‘attr2’:value2, … ]

* **Familiar grammar**
	Dino's syntax can be  easy to pick since 90% of its words are made up of Enlgish words. If you don't know English it's okay! By learning dino you'll pick up on basic vocabulary it's a win-win!
	* __Example:__ 
> [Dino] Math is 14 plus 12 divided by 2. What is Math?
>>Output:
>>20
(note: order of operations will follow PEMDAS automatically, no parenthesis needed)
